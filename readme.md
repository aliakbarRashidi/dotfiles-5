# Chris Knadler Dot Files
These are my config files to set up my development environment.

## Installation
I use [homesick][homesick] by Josh Nichols. To install my dotfiles using homesick just paste the following:

	$ gem install homesick
	$ homesick clone cknadler/dotfiles
	$ homesick symlink cknadler/dotfiles

## Credits
I made practically none of these dotfiles. They are mostly from:

* [ryanb/dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)
* [rtomayko/dotfiles](https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles)
* [technicalpickles/pickled-vim](https://github.com/technicalpickles/pickled-vim)
